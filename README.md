# Homework-Assignment-1
Create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:  

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice.   
2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 

I focus on require.js (never used): so when I could I refactor code moving an object to another file.
